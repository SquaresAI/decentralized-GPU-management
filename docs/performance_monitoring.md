# Performance Monitoring for GPU Nodes

## Overview
This guide outlines the tools and strategies for monitoring the performance of GPU nodes in the decentralized GPU management system.

---

## Key Performance Metrics
### GPU Utilization
Tracks how effectively the GPU is being used for assigned tasks. Ideal utilization is above 90% during active workloads.

### Memory Usage
Monitors VRAM consumption. Insufficient memory can lead to task failures.

### Task Throughput
Measures the number of AI tasks completed per hour.

### Network Latency
Monitors the time it takes to communicate with the blockchain and task scheduler.

## Monitoring Tools
### Command-Line Tools
1. **NVIDIA SMI**
   Use the `nvidia-smi` tool to check real-time GPU metrics:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=utilization.gpu,utilization.memory,memory.total,memory.free --format=csv
   ```

2. **Linux Tools**
   Monitor system resource usage with:
   - `top` for CPU and memory
   - `iotop` for disk I/O

### Monitoring Dashboards
1. **Prometheus + Grafana**
   Install Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for visualization. Use the NVIDIA Exporter for GPU-specific metrics.
2. **Custom Dashboard**
   Leverage the platformâ€™s built-in APIs to create custom dashboards for real-time monitoring.

## Alerts and Notifications
Set up alert thresholds for the following:
- GPU utilization drops below 50% for more than 10 minutes
- VRAM usage exceeds 90%
- Network latency exceeds 100ms

---

## Logging Best Practices
- Enable verbose logging in the GPU allocation software using the `--verbose` flag.
- Rotate logs daily to avoid storage overload:
   ```bash
   logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
   ```
