# Task Scheduling in Decentralized GPU Management

## Overview
Task scheduling ensures that workloads are efficiently distributed across available GPU nodes while balancing resource utilization and incentivization fairness.

---

## Task Scheduling Algorithm
The platform uses a priority-based scheduling algorithm with blockchain-backed accountability. Tasks are prioritized based on:
1. **Complexity**: Tasks requiring more compute power are assigned to higher-tier nodes.
2. **Node Reputation**: Nodes with higher uptime and reliability scores are prioritized.
3. **Stake Contribution**: Nodes with higher stakes in the blockchain system receive additional prioritization.

## Scheduling Process
### 1. Task Registration
Tasks are submitted via the platformâ€™s API. Each task includes:
- Model type (e.g., transformer, CNN)
- Dataset size
- Expected runtime
- Priority level

### 2. Resource Allocation
The scheduler assigns tasks to nodes based on the following:
- GPU specifications (e.g., VRAM, CUDA cores)
- Current workload on the node
- Historical performance of the node

### 3. Execution and Feedback
Nodes execute tasks and provide feedback to the scheduler. The feedback includes:
- Task completion time
- Resource consumption
- Anomalies encountered

---

## Blockchain Integration
Scheduling decisions are logged on the blockchain for transparency. Key data points include:
- Task assignment history
- Node performance metrics
- Rewards distributed for completed tasks

---

## Fault Tolerance
To handle node failures:
1. **Dynamic Reassignment**: Tasks are reassigned to backup nodes.
2. **Checkpointing**: Tasks are saved at regular intervals for resumption.

## Best Practices
- Ensure all tasks are properly tagged with metadata to optimize scheduling.
- Use redundant nodes for critical tasks to minimize downtime.
- Regularly update node performance data to improve scheduling accuracy.
