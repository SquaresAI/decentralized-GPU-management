# GPU Node Requirements

## Overview
To participate in the decentralized GPU network, nodes must meet specific hardware, software and network requirements. This ensures reliable performance and smooth interaction with the blockchain-based incentivization system.

## Hardware Requirements
### Minimum Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support, at least 8 GB of VRAM (e.g., GTX 1080 or equivalent)
- **CPU**: 4-core processor, 2.5 GHz or higher
- **RAM**: Minimum 16 GB
- **Storage**: At least 500 GB of SSD storage for caching models and data
- **Power Supply**: Sufficient to support GPU(s) under full load

### Recommended Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3080 or higher with 12 GB VRAM or more
- **CPU**: 8-core processor, 3.5 GHz or higher
- **RAM**: 32 GB or higher
- **Storage**: 1 TB NVMe SSD
- **Networking**: Gigabit Ethernet

---

## Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 or later, or Windows Server 2019 (Linux recommended)
- **Drivers**: Latest NVIDIA GPU drivers installed (e.g., version >= 510)
- **CUDA Toolkit**: Version 11.3 or later
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or later

### Required Libraries
Install the following Python libraries to enable core functionality:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy grpcio
```

---

## Network Requirements
- **Internet Speed**: Minimum 50 Mbps upload and download
- **Firewall Configuration**: Open ports 50051 (GRPC communication) and 30303 (blockchain interaction)
- **Latency**: Less than 50ms to main blockchain nodes

---

## Additional Notes
Ensure that the node remains operational 24/7. Downtime or hardware failures will result in reduced rewards and potential penalties in the blockchain staking system.
